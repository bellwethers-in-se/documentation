# Prevalance of Bellwethers in SE

## Defect Prediction
#### Jureczko
+ Lucene is the Bellwether Dataset (reported previously).
+ TCA+ performs the best when compared with other transfer learning methods overall.

+ The table below shows g-scores (Harmonic Mean of PD and PF)

#### Relink

+ ZXing is the Bellwether Dataset. 
+ Bellwether method is just as good as TCA+

## Code Smells


#### God Class
+ Xalan is the Bellwether (Note in Jureczko dataset, Xalan was the second best)
+ TCA+ no longer the best transfer learner. I think there are several reasons for this: (1) Sample size is very small (some datasets have only 5 samples. See above table.); (2) There are non-numeric columns and these can't be mapped to hilbert space.
+ VCBoosting could not be used for the same reasons above.

#### Feature Envy 

+ Xalan is absent, in this case, mvnforum is the bellwether.
+ Again the Bellwether Method is the best transfer learner

#### Long Method 

+ When looked at individually, Long Method and Data Class (below) are not very responsive to transfer learning. The PD and PD scores on average are well below 50%.
+ Although TCA+ seems to perform better, the results are too poor to draw a conclusion.

#### Data Class

## Effort Estimation

+ Table and radar chart tabulate the MMRE scores for 3 transfer learners. 
+ VCBoosting could not be used because of discrete discrete columns variables.
+ [cocomo](https://github.com/ai-se/x-effort/blob/cebe33069b350881f380e1acde1d7d9c1db2c074/Models/cocomo.py) data (which I believe was generated from the model) was the bellwether data set and Bellwether method was the best transfer learner.
